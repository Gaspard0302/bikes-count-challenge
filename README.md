# Bike Count Challenge: Predicting Velib Bike Availability in Paris

Welcome to the **Bike Count Challenge** repository! This project focuses on predicting the number of available bikes at various Velib stations across Paris using historical data. 
It was developed as part of a Kaggle challenge to enhance bike-sharing systems' efficiency and user experience.


## Overview

Bike-sharing systems like Velib in Paris have become integral to urban transportation, offering a convenient and eco-friendly way for residents and visitors to navigate the city. Efficient management of bike availability is crucial to meet user demand and optimize the system's performance. This project aims to build predictive models that estimate the number of available bikes at each Velib station based on historical usage data.

## Problem Statement

Despite the popularity of bike-sharing services, managing bike distribution remains a challenge. Peaks in demand can lead to shortages at certain stations, while other stations may experience overflows. Accurate forecasts of bike availability can inform operational decisions, such as redistribution of bikes and maintenance scheduling, ultimately improving user satisfaction and system sustainability.

**Objective:**  
Develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the number of available bikes at different Velib stations across Paris using historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises historical records of bike availability at Velib stations, enriched with geographic and temporal features.

**Key Features:**

- **Station Information:** Station ID, name, geographic coordinates.
- **Temporal Data:** Date, time, day of the week, holidays.
- **Weather Data:** Temperature, precipitation, wind speed, weather conditions.
- **Usage Metrics:** Number of bikes rented and returned, current availability.
